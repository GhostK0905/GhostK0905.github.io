 <h5> -------- 2 ---------------------------------- Failure --- </h5>
    <p>
       We began to test #2 on 15 test subjects. 6 test subjects immediately died within the first 10 minutes of intake. 
       Their bodies were quickly disposed of with no interesting results. 9 of the 15 test subjects lived for another 3 hours before needing 
       to recieve medical support, we attempted to stablize them right before their skin began to melt into a similar substance 
       as #1 which continued for the following 23 minutes. 
       Their bodies quickly obsorbed the substance after the 25 minute mark showing regenerative properties but unfortunetley this wasn't permanent. 
       They were pronounced dead shortly after.
    </p>
<h5> -------- 3 ---------------------------------- Failure --- </h5>
    <p> I gathered a group of another different 15 test subjects. The repetition of effects from #1 were successful! In the following 2 minutes 
       their wounds began to return with a blue colored substance oozing out ( not to be confused with #1 or other experiments ). The substance 
       began to quickly expand and seemed to consume their bodies whole, turning them into a humanoid figure. We terminated each of the subjects 
       after having realized that contamination of the area was in effect.
