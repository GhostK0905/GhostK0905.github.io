    <h1> Chavo </h1>
    <p>
        I'm Dr ▉▉▉▉, up until this point I've documented the writings of Chavo and have translated and done the best I could to read and note them down. While this may get me fired or in a worse case, terminated, I'll be happy knowning these may help future employees, "volunteers", or anyone who comes across this.

        Today I gave Timmothy a tophat that I had laying around. I think he liked it! I brought Soup over to meet him but I don't think they like each other very much. I think I'm going to have Timmothy around to see if they can get along or something. Oh and Raine also met him today! Timmothy says that he wants to see if Soup can help out around the lab but I don't think he's qualified to do so plus we've just been playing around and testing with the new equipment and if Timmothy knew he'd be upset that we're using them :/

        Timmothy told me about a factory he wants me to send out to make! He wants this really big room and told me how I can have a lab in there too! I really like the plans he's given me! OH and Soup gave him a new tophat in the office! Raine's also been getting stuck up on the roof and eventually broke his legs... but the TOPHAT it's so pretty and yellow and Timmothy really likes it!! I think they're all getting along!

        I don't know where Timmothy went during that short time period but Soup put him back into my office. I think I'll have Timmothy watch over the construction site for a while and continue to.. work here. I'll replace him for a different tree in the office, I need to give the fake his tophat but Timmothy really wants to hold onto it. I told him I'll get him a new one. Raine broke his legs again.
