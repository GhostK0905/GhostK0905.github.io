    <h1> WELCOME BACK MOTH MAN! YOU"RES THE BEST!!!! </h1>

    <p>
        Today I gave Timmothy a tophat that I had laying around. I think he liked it! I brought Soup over to meet him but I don't think they like each other very much. I think I'm going to have Timmothy around to see if they can get along or something. Oh and Raine also met him today! Timmothy says that he wants to see if Soup can help out around the lab but I don't think he's qualified to do so plus we've just been playing around and testing with the new equipment and if Timmothy knew he'd be upset that we're using them :/ I don't know what to do about him anymore he keeps getting in my fucking way. I want them all dead.
        stupid idiot stupid stupid stupid idiot stupid child that idiot stupid idiot stupid stupid stupid idiot stupid idiot dumb child that idiot stupid idiot stupid stupid stupid idiot stupid idiot dumb child that idiot stupid idiot stupid stupid stupid idiot stupid idiot child that idiot stupid idiot stupid stupid stupid idiot stupid idiot dumb child that idiot. I don't know where Timmothy went during that short time period but Soup put him back into my office. 
        I think I'll have Timmothy watch over the construction site for a while and continue to.. work here. Why did I have to turn him into a plant again? I'll replace him for a different tree in the office, I need to give the fake his tophat but Timmothy really wants to hold onto it. I told him I'll get him a new one. Raine broke his legs again.
        He's getting on my nerves and I'm tired of having to mindlessly listen to everything they say. Nothing is working and nothing is helping it's making everything worse. 
        Timmothy told me about a factory he wants me to send out to make! He wants this really big room and told me how I can have a lab in there too! I really like the plans he's given me! OH and Soup gave him a new tophat in the office! Raine's also been getting stuck up on the roof and eventually broke his legs... but the TOPHAT it's so pretty and yellow and Timmothy really likes it!! I think they're all getting along!
        They aren't listening to a single word I say and dismissing it as rambling. I really want to make a nice meal for everyone :D I think they'll enjoy some old recipies I was taught from madre! I miss her so much :( she was really nice and always made me desserts! I think she'd be really proud of what I'm doing rn yknow :D I'm still wainting for those bouncy castles they seem really cool!
