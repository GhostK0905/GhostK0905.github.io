    <h1> The Factory </h1>
    <p> Last Updated: January 25, 2023 </p>
    <p> It's been weeks since the factory went up in flames. Not much has been retrieved up until this point in time. Our team has been trying their best to clean out the area to find any useful information. The laboratory seems to have remained intact but the collapse of the higher levels have made it difficult to obtain resources burried below.</p>
