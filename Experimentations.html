       Experiment #2 - Fail
   </h5>
   
   <p> We began to test #2 on 15 test subjects. 6 test subjects immediately died within the first 10 minutes of intake. Their bodies were quickly disposed of with no interesting results. The 9 that "survived" lived for another 3 hours before needing to recieve medical support, we attempted to stablize them right before their skin began to melt into a similar substance as #1, this exposed their inner tissues and muscles in the following 23 minutes. Their bodies quickly obsorbed the substance but it didn't have any lasting effects, they died within the next hour.

   <h5>
      Experiment #3 - Fail
   </h5>
   
   <p> I gathered a group of another different 15 test subjects. The repitition of effects from #1 were successfull but unfortunately they didn't last long. In the following minutes ( mayyybe 2-3 ) their wounds began to return with a blue colored subtance oozing out ( not to be confusd with #1 or other expiriments ). The substance quickly began to expand and seemed to consume their bodies whole turning them into a humanoid figure. We terminated each of the subjects and have portions of the subjects in a very neat tube for further inspection.
