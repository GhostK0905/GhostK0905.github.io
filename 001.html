AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAApples are kinda mid ngl tbh. I saw a really nice cardinal perched up on a stick today! I couldn't catch a photo of it :( I also saw two blue jays which made me sad but yeah that's what's up with me :D Speaking of birds, did you know the glass frog can jump more than ten feet in one jump. The male frog guards the females' fertilized eggs placed on leaves until they hatch and the tadpoles fall into the water. The translucent skin of some species permits an observer to see the frog's beating heart. Glass frogs live up to 14 years. I saw thi on goggle when looking for a frog I saw like last year near my house :DDD
