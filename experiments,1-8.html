    <p> We began to test #2 on 15 test subjects. 6 test subjects immediately died within the first 10 minutes of intake. Their bodies were quickly disposed of with no interesting results. 9 subjects lived for another 3 hours before needing to recieve medical support, we attempted to stablize them right before their skin began to melt into a similar substance as #1, this exposed their inner tissues and muscles in the following 23 minutes. Their bodies quickly  obsorbed the substance but it didn't have any lasting effects. They died within the following hour.
    </p>




    <p> I gathered a group of another different 15 test subjects. The repetition of effects from #1 was successful but unfortunately they didn't last long. In the following 2 minutes their wounds began to return with a blue colored substance oozing out ( not to be confused with #1 or other experiments ). The substance began to quickly expand and seemed to consume their bodies whole, turning them into a humanoid figure. We terminated each of the subjects and had portions of the subjects in a very neat tube for further inspection.
